## About this book@cha_why### Structure of the bookWe will start with the exploration of message passing. As we described in  _Learning Object-Oriented Programming, Design and TDD with Pharo_ sending a message is making a choice. The execution engine selects and executes for us the correct method. Such mechanism is really powerful and we will explore what we can then do by just sending messages. To make sure that you can read this book in isolation, I will reuse two chapters from _Learning Object-Oriented Programming, Design and TDD with Pharo_ available at [http://books.pharo.org](http://books.pharo.org): First the _Crafting a simple embedded DSL with Pharo_ chapter and second with the _A little expression interpreter_ chapter.- Reusing and extending the _Crafting a simple embedded DSL with Pharo_. We will extend the Dice mini system to support more additions between die and die handle. We will explore the notion of double dispatch. Double dispatch is a subtle notion that requires time to master. Indeed even when we believe that we fully understand it, our old deamons can push us to blindly use conditionals when this is not needed.- Reusing and extending _A little expression interpreter_, we will as a basis to explore the Visitor design pattern. In fact the Visitor is a generalisation of double dispatch. ### Typographic conventionsPharo expressions or code snippets are represented either in the text as `'Hello'` and `'Hello' reversed`, or for more substantial snippets, as follows:```'Hello'```When we want to show the result of evaluating an expression, we show the result after three chevrons `>>>` on the next line, like so:```testcase=true'Hello' reversed
>>> 'olleH'```Whenever we feel the text makes a point that is important or technical enough to be highlighted, we will do so with a thick bar:!!note Important! This is a point that is worth drawing some more attention.### ThanksI would like to thank the following persons for their feedback: Roelof Wobben.
